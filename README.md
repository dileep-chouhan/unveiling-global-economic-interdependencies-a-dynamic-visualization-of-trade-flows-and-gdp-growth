# Unveiling Global Economic Interdependencies: A Dynamic Visualization of Trade Flows and GDP Growth

## Overview

This project aims to visualize the correlation between global trade flows and GDP growth across different nations.  By leveraging publicly available economic data, we create an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore these interdependencies. This analysis helps businesses identify emerging market opportunities, assess potential risks, and make more informed strategic decisions. The project performs data cleaning, analysis, and visualization to present key insights in a clear and accessible manner.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn


## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**  `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the main script:** `python main.py`

## Example Output

The script will generate an interactive dashboard visualizing the relationship between global trade flows and GDP growth.  The dashboard allows users to filter data by country, year, and other relevant parameters.  Additionally, the script will print a summary of key findings to the console, including correlations and potentially significant trends.  No separate plot files are generated; the visualization is interactive within the dashboard.  The specific format and content of the console output may vary depending on the data and analysis performed.
